# wiki-bot

This is a super simple Telegram Bot which sends a featured Wikipedia article of the day in Russian for you every day. 
In the nearest future, I'll add some new features like the ability to switch language and maybe the theme of articles.

In this project I used Axios for getting the page, Cheerio to get needed data and Express to routing.
I deployed a project on the Heroku and configure CRON service for everyday notifications from the server and pushing the article to the Telegram.
